# What is HTML?
The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.


## Why HTML?
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.

## HTML Structure :

1. line containing HTML version information.
2. head a declarative header section.
3. body which contains the document's actual content.
    - header
    - main
    - footer


## Example :

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<HTML>
   <HEAD>
      <TITLE>My first HTML document</TITLE>
   </HEAD>
   <BODY>
      <P>Hello world!</P>
   </BODY>
</HTML>
```


# What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

## Why CSS?
CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users how they are styled, laid out, etc.
A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language  HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.

## CSS syntax : 
```
h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}
```
## How to use CSS and HTML ?
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

- **Inline** - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
- **Internal** - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
- **External** - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.
