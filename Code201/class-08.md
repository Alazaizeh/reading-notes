## What is HTML?

The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

## HTML Structure :

1. line containing HTML version information.
2. head a declarative header section.
3. body which contains the document's actual content.
   - header
   - main
   - footer

   
## What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

## Why CSS?
CSS is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. **HTML** to define the content of web pages

   2. **CSS** to specify the layout of web pages

   3. **JavaScript** to program the behavior of web pages
   
## How to use CSS and HTML ?
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

- **Inline** - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
- **Internal** - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
- **External** - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. 

# Layout

## HTML Layout Elements

- `<header> `- Defines a header for a document or a section
- `<nav> ` - Defines a set of navigation links
- `<section> `- Defines a section in a document
- `<article> `- Defines an independent, self-contained content
- `<aside> `- Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- `<footer> `- Defines a footer for a document or a section
- `<details> `- Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
- `<summary> `- Defines a heading for the `<details>` element

## Positioning schemes

- Normal flow
- Relative Positioning
- Absolute positioning

## Position

- position: static;
- position: relative;
- position: fixed;
- position: absolute;
- position: sticky;

## Floating Elements

The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.

## Clearing Floats

The clear property allows you
to say that no element
should touch the left or righthand sides of a box.
