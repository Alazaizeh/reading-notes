# canvas
At first sight a `<canvas>` looks like the` <img>` element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes.Indeed, the `<canvas>` element has only two attributes, `width` and` height` and These are both optional .
``` 
    <canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas> 
```
