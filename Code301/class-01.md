## What is a component?
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components
## What are the charactistics of a component?
- **Reusability** − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- **Replaceable** − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- **Not context specific** − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- **Extensible** − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- **Encapsulated** − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- **Independent** − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

## What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
1. Ease of deployment 
2. Reduced cost 
3. Ease of development
4. Reusable 
5. Modification of technical complexity
6. Reliability 
7. System maintenance and evolution
8. Independent 

## What is props short for?
`Props` is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties.
## How are props used in React?
 It is being used for passing data from one component to another.
## What is the flow of props?
Data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow.
Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
