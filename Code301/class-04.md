# React

## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
 An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them to take advantage of Conditional Rendering
## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
using onChange we can simply target what the user is entering
## Why would we use a ternary operator?
We use the ternary operator to simplify our if-else statements.
## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
```
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
  ```
  ans:
`x===y ? console.log(true):console.log(false); `
