### Who is Roy Fielding?
Roy Thomas Fielding is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style. 
### Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
Machines will not be sitting down at the desk and browsing the web. But computers can use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other. We've been doing that for a long time but none of the techniques we use today work well when you need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the entire world.
### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
### What does a GET do?
The GET method means retrieve whatever information is identified by the Request-URI.
### What does a POST do?
The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions
### What does PUT do?
The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.
### What does PATCH do?
The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource.
