## Solving Problems
A simple set of steps
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.
## Act like you make $1000/hr
If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.
But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.
What you think is what you become. If you think your time is worth a few bucks an hour, that you’ll begin to act like it. You’ll find yourself saying “yes” to meaningless, pointless obligations.
But if, in your heart, you know your time is valuable…
  - People will recognize that.
  - People will respect that.
  - People will treat you differently.
  
  If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can’t have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken.
  - You become what you are.
  - You attract what you look for.
## How to think like a programmer

#### Why is this important?
Problem solving is the meta-skill.

We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):

- Try a solution.
- If that doesn’t work, try another one.
- If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.
The best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?
#### Here are the steps:

1. Understand
2. Plan
3. Divide
4. Stuck?

## The 5 Whys Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly
Have you ever had a problem that refused to go away? No matter what you did, sooner or later it would return, perhaps in another form.

Stubborn or recurrent problems are often symptoms of deeper issues. "Quick fixes" may seem convenient, but they often solve only the surface issues and waste resources that could otherwise be used to tackle the real cause.
1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop
