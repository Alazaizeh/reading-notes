*    Standardized
*    Provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards
*    Built-in error handling
*    Automation when used with certain language products

**REST Advantages**
REST is easier to use for the most part and is more flexible. It has the following advantages over SOAP:
*    No expensive tools require to interact with the web service
*    Smaller learning curve
*    Efficient (SOAP uses XML for all messages, REST can use smaller message formats)
