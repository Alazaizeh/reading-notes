### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
1. reduces the time required for project development
2. Code flexibility and easier maintenance
3. With TDD you will get a reliable solution.

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
If you have some work you need to do repeatedly for many tests, you can use beforeEach and afterEach.
### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
Tests help to seek out bugs, but they can not find bugs that you simply introduce within the test code and in implementation code
### Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
Class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance
### Why REST?
One of the key advantages of REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls

|Term|Description|
|----|----|
|functional programming| a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. |
|object-oriented programming (OOP)|  a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields. |
|class| In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects |
|super|Super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable |
|this| The current object |
|Test Driven Development (TDD)| Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed |
|Jest| Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. |
|Continuous Integration (CI)| CI is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project |
|REST| REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways. |
|Data Model| A data model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world |
