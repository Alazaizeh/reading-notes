### Write the following steps in the correct order:
1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
3. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
4. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
5. Make a request to the access token endpoint
6. Receive access token
7. Receive authorization code

### What can you do with an authorization code?
authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.
### What can you do with an access token?
Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user.
### Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
OAuth is a delegated authorization framework for REST/APIs. It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user's data without giving away a user's password. It decouples authentication from authorization and supports multiple use cases addressing different device capabilities.
