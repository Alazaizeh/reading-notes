# Functional Programming:
### What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects
### What are the benefits of a pure function?
1. Immutability
2. Referential transparency
### What is immutability?
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
### What is Referential transparency?
Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

`pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency`

# Node:
### What is a module?
Module in Node. js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.
### What does the word ‘require’ do?
The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules
### How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
require()
### What do we have to do to make a module available?
module.exports
