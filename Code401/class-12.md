 To meet the demands of pervasive data-centric applications and services
### UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
UDP is a connectionless protocol. It is known as a datagram protocol because it is analogous to sending a letter where you don't acknowledge receipt.
### Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
Yes as long as they are associated with different client-side
