6. Splay tree
7. Treap
8. B-tree

  - Tree reflects structural relationships in the data.
  - It is used to represent hierarchies.
  - It provides an efficient insertion and searching operations.
  - Trees are flexible. It allows to move subtrees around with minimum effort.
  
### What is the difference between Tree and graph?
