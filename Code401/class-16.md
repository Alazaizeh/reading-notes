## AWS: Cloud Servers
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center.

### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app
### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.
### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
Software deployment refers to the process of making the application work on a target device, whether it be a test server, production environment or a user's computer or mobile device.
