### AWS events
 a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources.

### Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server
service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale.
### List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each

|pros|cons|
|----|----|
|Automated Backups|No scale-out for write workloads|
|Encryption at rest and in-transit|Downtime required for scaling operations|
|No hardware maintenance needed	|No automated partition management|

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
Standard queues guarantee that a message is delivered at least once and duplicates can be introduced into the queue. FIFO queues ensure a message is delivered exactly once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it
### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
Wait for acknowledgement from the client as a response for reciving the message.

|Dynamo vs Mongo|DynamoDB is a key-value store with added support for JSON to provide document-like data structures that better match with objects in application code, Compared to MongoDB, DynamoDB has limited support for different data types|
|Dynamoose vs Mongoose|Dynamoose is obviously inspired by mongoose and is a good choice if you have a well-defined schema and/or want to be abstracted away from the DynamoDB details.|
