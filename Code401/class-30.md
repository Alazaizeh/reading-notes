### what is Hash Tables ?
a hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. 
### What are Hash Tables used for?
A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs.
### What are some uses for a hash table?
Hash tables are commonly used to implement many types of in-memory tables. They are used to implement associative arrays (arrays whose indices are arbitrary strings or other complicated objects), especially in interpreted programming languages like Ruby, Python, and PHP.
### How do you know when to use a hash table?
Hash tables are good for doing a quick search on things. For instance if we have an array full of data (say 100 items). If we knew the position that a specific item is stored in an array, then we could quickly access it.
### What is the time complexity of a Hash Tables ?
Like arrays, hash tables provide constant-time O(1) lookup on average, regardless of the number of items in the table.

### What are advantages of Hash Tables ?
The main advantage of hash tables over other data structures is speed . The access time of an element is on average O(1), therefore lookup could be performed very fast. Hash tables are particularly efficient when the maximum number of entries can be predicted in advance
