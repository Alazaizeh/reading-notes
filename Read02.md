# What is Git?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.


## Why Git?
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to

## Example :
***git clone [url]***
This command is used to obtain a repository from an existing URL.

## Commands With Examples :

| Command | Syntax |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Add | `git add [file] ` |
| Commit	| `git commit -m “[ Type in the commit message]”` |
| Status | `git status ` |
| Rm| `git rm [file]` |
| Push|`git push [variable name] master  `|
