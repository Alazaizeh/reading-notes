# What is HTML?
The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.



## What is an HTML Element?

The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets  these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it. Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.

`<tagname>Content goes here</tagname>`

## Why HTML?
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.

## HTML Structure :

1. line containing HTML version information.
2. head a declarative header section.
3. body which contains the document's actual content.
    - header
    - main
    - footer


## Example :

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<HTML>
   <HEAD>
      <TITLE>My first HTML document</TITLE>
   </HEAD>
   <BODY>
      <P>Hello world!</P>
   </BODY>
</HTML>
```
