# Comparison Operators 

You may be familiar with comparison operators from math class. Let’s make sure there aren’t any gaps in your knowledge.

- Comparison operators — operators that compare values and return true or false.

less than greater than or equal to

| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| > |  Greater than |
| < | Less than |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |
| <= | Less than or equal to |
| == | Equal to |
| === |  Equal value and same type |
| != | Not Equal to |
| !== | Not Equal value or Not same type |

# Logical Operators

Comparison operators allow us to assert the equality of a statement with JavaScript. For example, we can assert whether two values or expressions are equal or whether one value is greater than another.

- Logical operators — operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output.


| Operator | Meaning |

| `&&` | AND |
|` ||` | OR |
