# What is HTML?
The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.


## Why HTML?
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.


## What is an HTML Element?

The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets  these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it. Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.

`<tagname>Content goes here</tagname>`

## HTML Structure :

1. line containing HTML version information.
2. head a declarative header section.
3. body which contains the document's actual content.
    - header
    - main
    - footer


## Example :

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<HTML>
   <HEAD>
      <TITLE>My first HTML document</TITLE>
   </HEAD>
   <BODY>
      <P>Hello world!</P>
   </BODY>
</HTML>
```

## Commonly Used HTML Tags :

| **Tags** | **Use** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `<HTML>. . . </HTML>` | The entire HTML document |
| `<HEAD> . . . </HEAD>` | 	The head of the HTML document |
| `<BODY> . . . </BODY>` | All the other content in the HTML document |
| `<TITLE> . . . </TITLE>` | 	The title of the document |
| `<H1> . . . </H1> `| First-level heading large text size |
|` <H6> . . . </H6> `| Sixth-level heading small text size |
|`<P> . . . </P>`|**Paragraph** You need to use this tag to make a new paragraph.|
|`<BR>`|**Line Break** This tag will show a blank line.|

## The Evolution of HTML
- **HTML 1.0**
The introduction of HTML 1.0 was with an objective to share data and information which can be accessed through web browsers. Version 1.0 was not that popular. The reason was the insufficiency in developers who are involved in creating websites at that time. Due to this, the growth of the language then was very disappointing.

- **HTML 2.0**
After HTML 1.0, HTML 2.0 was launched in 1995. All the features of HTML 1.0 were included in this succeeding version. This version remained as the standard for developing websites until 1997.

- **HTML 3.0**
On January 14, 1997, HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
It was exclusively developed and standardized by W3C as IETF ended its support over HTML on September 12, 1996. When compared with 2.0, 3.2 provides features such as tables, applets, text flow around images, superscripts and subscripts. 

- **HTML 4**
This version provides many extensions when compared to the previous version. Tools like style sheets, scripting, frames, embedding objects, improved support for the right to left and mixed direction text, richer tables, and enhancements to forms, offering improved accessibility for people with disabilities. 

- **HTML 5**â€“ The current version
HTML 5 is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by the members of Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) which include vendors like Apple, Google, Mozilla, Microsoft etc. The official release of HTML 5 was on 22 January 2008. The update brought many updates and features like application programming interfaces (APIs) which enabled developers to build complex web applications using HTML.
